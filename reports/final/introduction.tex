\chapter{Introduction}

Getting computers to understand human language is a complex task. :)

Introduction - not started

\textbf{Prelims} - in progress

Task definitions - needs section on POS tagging

Datset -
SemEval - needs formatting and re-check  

Machine Learning part - needs semi-supervised and self-training parts

validation - make sure we generalize well, not started yet

Neural Networks

need graph and soma reference



Optimization - not started

need reference to maximum loglikelihood

regularization - not started


Conv need structuring and formatting


\textbf{Related Works} - in progress
    
    CNNs - need a small paragraph for each network since 2015

need semi-supervised section


Discussion - not started
Conclusion - not started


\section{Problem definition}


\section{Research Questions}

I have formulated the following tentative research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the current state-of-the-art systems for relation classification 
    with neural networks?\\
    \item Is it possible to simplify structures in state-of-the-art systems while maintaining (or increasing) the F1 metric?\label{research_q:simplify}
\end{itemize}
