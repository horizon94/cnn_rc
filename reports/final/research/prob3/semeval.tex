\subsection{Overfitting as a community}

\subsubsection{Problems with SemEval}

.. How do we actually prove this? Perplexity from SemEval -> any other data set is poor. Also the train-test perplexity is relatively low.

\subsubsection{Generalizes poorly}

The entity selection process is obscure and hard to apply in general. Getting new entities is not easy ... ?
Idea: Do a run of the experiment without pos embedding, and then observe self-training.?

\subsection{Solutions to the SemEval problem}

We are probably bound somewhat to the dataset due to the rarity of quality relation classification datasets.

\subsubsection{Dont use the official test-train split}
Generate a random test-train split from the data. The same samples are not interesting, not even for comparison.

\subsubsection{Dont use the official scorer}
Use test loss because it assumes less about the actual meaning of the systems. 
Designing a system for semantic relation classification, not for semeval relation classification :)

\subsubsection{Dont use SemEval without other tasks}

The model should be applied to another similar tasks. The dataset sune showed is a good example.
Effects on early stopping and the setup in general.
