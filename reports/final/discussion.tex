discussion points 

why feature-based systems are not as interesting:

key observation - language came before understanding language at depth

we don't want a deeper understanding of language than we have in a practical application


quote wikipedia on corpus:
``
In practice, fully checking and completing the parsing of natural language corpora is a 
labour-intensive project that can take teams of graduate linguists several years
``
So either we do this to train a computer faster, or to make up for a lack of 
generalization power
